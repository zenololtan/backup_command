step 1. copy/paste the backup_script directory in your user directory. your pathname should look like this: /users/username/backup_command/backup_script

step 2. paste:

source ~/backup_script/custom_command.sh

at the end of your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file.

be sure to modify your directory name in the backup_script.sh file!!
